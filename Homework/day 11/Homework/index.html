   <h1 align="center">What is Penguin</h1>
<b><i style="color: peru">A penguin is a flightless bird that is well-adapted to life in the water. Penguins are known for their distinctive black and white plumage, which helps camouflage them while swimming. They have flipper-like wings that enable them to navigate through the water with remarkable agility. While penguins are flightless, their wings are adapted for swimming, allowing them to cover long distances in search of food.

    Penguins are primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, with the majority inhabiting the colder regions of Antarctica. However, they can also be found in various sub-Antarctic islands, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and South America. Some species, like the Galápagos penguin, inhabit more temperate climates near the equator.
    
    Penguins are known for their social behavior and often form large colonies for breeding and protection. They feed on a diet consisting mainly of fish, squid, and krill. Popular penguin species include the Emperor penguin, King penguin, Adélie penguin, and Gentoo penguin, among others. Penguins have become iconic and are often associated with the cold and icy environments of the Antarctic, although not all species inhabit such extreme conditions.</i></b>
